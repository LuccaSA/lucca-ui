<section class="lui red callout">
	<p>
		Inputs have been heavily refactored in version <span class="lui label">3.0</span>. Inputs definitions are now intertwined with AngularJS, as their styling
		is based upon the ng classes <code>ng-invalid</code>, <code>ng-touched</code>, etc...
	</p>
	<p>
		A demonstration of input can be seen in the <a ui-sref="formly">forms section</a>.
